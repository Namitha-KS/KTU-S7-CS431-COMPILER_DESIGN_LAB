Algorithm for Lexical Analyzer Using Lex
Define Tokens and Counters:

Decide which tokens (e.g., keywords, operators, identifiers, numbers) need to be recognized by the lexical analyzer.
Set up counters for lines, words, special characters, etc., if needed.
Set Up Lex Definitions:

Use the %{ %} block in Lex to include necessary libraries (like stdio.h) and define variables or counters.
Define Token Matching Rules:

Inside the Lex rule section, define patterns for each token:
Newlines: \n for line counting.
Words/Identifiers: [a-zA-Z]+ for alphabetic strings.
Numbers: [0-9]+ for integers.
Operators/Special Characters: Define each special character or operator (e.g., +, -, *, /, etc.).
Whitespace: " " to count spaces.
Quoted Strings: \"[^\"]*\" to match text within double quotes.
Use { action } to specify what to do when a pattern is matched, like updating counters or printing matched tokens.
Write Actions for Each Token:

For each defined pattern, write actions to process and track the token, such as:
Counting the token type.
Printing the matched token if needed.
Checking specific patterns within tokens (e.g., looking for a keyword in a string).
Handle Unmatched Characters:

Define a rule for unmatched characters, typically using . to match any single character not previously defined.
Main Function:

In main(), open the input file and pass it to Lex for processing.
Call yylex() to start the lexical analysis.
Summary (Optional):

After lexical analysis, print the results such as total characters, words, lines, etc.
Compile and Run:

Use flex to generate the C code from the Lex file.
Compile the generated C file and run the executable with an input file.
